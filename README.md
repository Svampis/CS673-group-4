# CS673-group-4
This is the repo for the CS673 group project


We are going to create an app that will allow homeowners to schedule residential services with local tradesmen, such as plumbing, HVAC, electrical, etc. This app will consist of homeowner accounts and tradesmen accounts. From the tradesman's account, you will be able to list your credentials and experience and list locations and time slots of availability. From the homeowner's account, you will be able to browse for tradesmen by profession and location and create appointments in the available time slots, which will be subsequently accepted or rejected by the tradesman. Once the tradesman has accepted, there will be messaging functionality allowing the homeowner and the tradesman to message each other. There will also be functionality for the tradesman to post a cost estimate based on footage of the damage, answers to initial survey questions posed to the users, both which will be made available to the tradesman, as well as what is discussed using the messaging feature. There will also be basic service-oriented functionality like ratings, reviews, etc. In addition to this, there will also be functionality to set up longer-term contracts, such as for new construction. In these instances, the contract will be based on a bid whose parameters are established by the owner/general contractor, such that the lowest bidding tradesman gets the contract.

In accordance with this, we have devised the following product vision

FOR Tradesmen, homeowners, general contractors
WHO Are looking for residential work (for tradesmen) or have a plumbing/electrical/HVAC issue that needs to be repaired (for homeowners), or are recruiting for new construction or similar long-term projects (general contractors)
THE RoofConnect is an on-demand service scheduling platform
THAT connects tradesmen to homeowners and general contractors
UNLIKE Angie's list
OUR PRODUCT has functionality to list available time slots and for tradesmen to accept/reject jobs and has bidding functionality for contracts
